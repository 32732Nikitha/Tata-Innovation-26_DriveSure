# ✨ Core Capabilities

## 🌫️ Smart Fog Detection
Detects low-visibility environmental conditions using trained machine learning models and sensor-based analysis to assist safer driving decisions.

## 🛣️ Real-Time Pothole Recognition
Uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to identify potholes and damaged road surfaces from live video streams.

## 🛞 Tire Health Prediction
Predicts tire degradation levels using neural network-based analysis of vehicle and road-condition parameters.

## 📹 Live Video Monitoring
Supports webcam and live stream integration for continuous road condition analysis using WebRTC.

## 📊 Interactive Analytics Dashboard
Provides an intuitive Streamlit interface for monitoring predictions, alerts, and visual insights in real time.

## ⚡ Fast Deployment
Simple project setup with modular architecture for quick experimentation and deployment.
